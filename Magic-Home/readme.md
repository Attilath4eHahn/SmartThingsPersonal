A lot of peope have had interest in this app over the last few weeks. Setting up a dedicated thread for it.

Magic home allows for four hello home scenes to be run based on 2 conditions. 1) Occupancy of your home 2) the current "sun state".

This allows for you to have a sunrise and sunset mode for when your home is occupied and not occupied. I currently have mine setup like this.

Away Day - Will trigger when everyone is away and the sun is up

Away Night - Will trigger when everyone is away and the sun is down

Home Day - Will trigger when someone is home and the sun is up

Home Night - Will trigger when someone is home and the sun is down

Everything is automated and it will trigger on each event. So everytime the "sun state" changes it will check to see if anyone is home as well as everytime the presence changes it will check to see if the sun is up. This has become a integral part in my automation.

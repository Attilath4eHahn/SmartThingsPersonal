Basically it controls your thermostat mode (heat, cool, off, auto) from a customizable temperature range from a external sensor. So if you want it to be in a "cooling" state when it is warm outside you can do that! If you want to have it off when it is between 40 and 70 degree (like i do) you can do that, and of course if it is below 40 degrees you can put it into a "heating" state.

The exciting part here is I have added the ability to check contact sensors as well! So if you want to open your doors during the warmer months my app will see that and turn off your thermostat for you!

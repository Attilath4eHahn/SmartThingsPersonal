I have made some huge improvements to the "Light Follows Me App". Basically I have created one app that can house 15 "scenes". This is really cool because I hate having so many apps that I can't find the one I want so this takes all of my lighting rules and moves it into one app.

Each scene is independent of each other and can be triggered my motion. Each scene can be restriceted to run only when a certain lux value is below a customizable level. Then you can have that trigger turn on lights and even dim them to a certain level if you want. After motion stops you can choose to turn the scene off as well.
